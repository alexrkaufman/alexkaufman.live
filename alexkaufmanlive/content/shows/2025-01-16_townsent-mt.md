Early in his career, Ronn Vigh's brash attitude and acerbic wit earned him a comparison to a young Joan Rivers by the SF Weekly. It was certainly a fitting comparison as Ronn later became a writer for Rivers on her hit E! Television show "Fashion Police."

Ronn regularly performs at comedy clubs, colleges and festivals across the nation. He also co-hosts the sports-comedy podcast, "Switching Teams: A Gay Dude & A Straight Dude Talk About Sports."

His biggest accomplishment: Working briefly as a flight attendant and not attempting to smother any of his passengers with a pillow. Yes, there were complimentary pillows on the plane when Ronn did that job. Please don't do the math.
