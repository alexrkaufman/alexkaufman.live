## About the Show

If you haven't heard of me, hello nice to meet you! I am a standup comedian from Montana on tour coming to Sioux City, Iowa. I used to do physics research but decided instead to tell jokes while waiting for the heat death of the universe. My mom was not thrilled.

Don't let the physics background scare you away. I promise not to talk about physics (much) and I wont make you do any math, or your money back! How many other physicists have you met who can make that promise? If you want to learn more about me I trust you to be able to click links on this site or send me an email.

**Feature**: Ocho De La Rosa
Ocho De La Rosa is a little comedian with a big mouth and even bigger heart. Originally from San Antonio, TX and now residing in Omaha, De La Rosa gives a performance that is unique and relatable; and while it leaves crowds laughing, it also leaves them questioning their sanity and maybe their sexuality. De La Rosa seamlessly blends their quirky charm and quick wit in performances across many Midwest bar stages and the occasional comedy club. De La Rosa puts their heart on the stage the same way they put their backwards hat on their head- intentionally fumbled.

**Host**: Drake Strong
Drake Strong born and raised in Sioux City, and co-runner of Siouxland Comedy has preformed across the miswesr and opened for Kevin Farley and Steven Michael Quezada. He jokes about his life, family, and observations of the world woth a dark twist at times.
