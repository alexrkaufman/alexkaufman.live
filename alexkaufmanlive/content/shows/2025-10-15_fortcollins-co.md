## About

Created in the back of a Thai restaurant in Seattle in 2014 and now one of the most prolifically touring international comedy showcases in the world, The Gateway Show has a simple premise: Stand-up comedians take to the stage sober to tell their BEST jokes, then they go to an undisclosed location to get WAY too high, only to come back to the stage and ATTEMPT to tell more jokes while completely stoned.
